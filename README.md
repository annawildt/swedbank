### What Does It Do?
This is a case study from Swedbank.

The functionality that this application fulfills is:

- With the ID of a logged in Swedbank session, 
it can get the valid authentication methods for the logged in account.

- It can take a social security number as input and initiate a 
Mobile BankID login and then check the status of the login 1/s for 10s.

### TODO
- Application does not include validation of the last 4 digits of SSN
- Application doesn't allow for temporary SSN format, only valid dates
